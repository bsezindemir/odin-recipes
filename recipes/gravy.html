        <h4>INGREDIENTS</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>meat juices</li>
                <li>2 tbsp liquid meat fat</li>
                <li>30 g/1oz plain flour</li>
                <li>570 ml/1 pint stock</li>
                <li>2 tsp gravy browning (optional)</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h4>STEPS</h4>

            <ol>
                <li>Collect the juices and the fat from the meat you are roasting. Put the juices in a glass jug and allow to stand for a few minutes so that the fat will rise to the surface. Skim off the fat.</li>
                <li>Put the roasting tin that you used to cook the meat on the hob on a medium heat and add the fat. (The meat needs to be resting, covered with foil, in a warm place at this point)</li>
                <li>Stir in the flour and cook for 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Stir in the meat juices and gradually stir in the stock until you get a smooth gravy. Use a wooden spoon and stir all over the surface of the pan to incorporate any meat juices that are stuck to it.</li>
                <li>Bring to the boil and allow to simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Season to taste and add a little gravy browning if desired.</li>
            </ol>
